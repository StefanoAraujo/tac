# Open Mainframe Project mailing lists

Open Mainframe Project maintains a number of mailing lists for the foundation itself, it's members, and the community at large. These mailing lists are hosted at [groups.io](https://groups.io) and managed by the Linux Foundation staff and Open Mainframe Project community leadership.

## Key mailing lists

The primary mailing list for all techincal community discussion is [omp-technical@lists.openmainframeproject.org](https://lists.openmainframeproject.org/g/omp-technical). Each hosted project and working group has it's own mailing list as well, which are [listed in the project listing in the TAC repo](https://github.com/openmainframeproject/tac#tac-projects).

### Moderation

By default, TSC voting members serve as the moderator for discussions in [omp-technical@lists.openmainframeproject.org](https://lists.openmainframeproject.org/g/omp-technical), and each hosted project's TSC will serve as moderator for it's mailing lists. Moderation privledges can be extended to others upon a vote by the TAC or respective TSC as applicable.
